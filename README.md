# Installation
To install the aplication, you will download the **dist** folder, and then, execute the **Minecraft Manager Setup.exe**

# Tips to know
- **The aplication will create a MinecraftManager folder** on your **Documents** folder. Then, inside this folder, you will see a **Mods** folder and a **Texture-Packs**, you will put the .jar files inside the **Mods** folder and, in the **Texture-Packs**, you will put the compression files to install the textures.
- This application was created with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- When you install the application, **your antivirus will warn you**, but don't panic, this application has no virus, the thing is that is not signed with a certificate of a certificator, this cost money :disappointed:
